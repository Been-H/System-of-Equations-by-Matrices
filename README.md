# System-of-Equations-by-Matrices
A program that solves any length system of equations using augmented matrices and elementary row operations. I have thourghouly tested it and it seems to work for all non-quadratic equations.

*Note: This is a really old project so the OOP is probably not as good as it could be. I made some changes like moving update columns into the Matrix class itself and rather than passing lenSystem into literally every Matrix method I can just encapsulate it and make it an instance attribute.
