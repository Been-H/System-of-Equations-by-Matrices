# System-of-Equations-by-Matrices
A program that solves any length system of equations using augmented matrices and elementary row operations. I have thourghouly tested it and it seems to work for all non-quadratic equations.

*Note: This is a really old project so the oop is not my brightest. The lenSystem variable gets passed into every single function when it could have just been ecapsulated in the Matrix class as an instance attribute.
